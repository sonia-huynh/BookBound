BookBound is a personal book review and rating app similar to Goodreads just without the social aspect 🤭. I am currently building this app because I love to read and review books and as a perk I can also consolidate my learning on using external APIs and how to build a fullstack web app from scratch. 

### ✅ Features I currently have:
* User can search up any book they want in the search bar
* User can add any book they like into their own personal library
* User can see all the books saved in their personal library
* User can write a book review for any book saved in their personal library
* User can update a book review
* User can delete any book review saved in their personal library
* User can rate any book
* User can update a book rating or delete it
* User My Reviews page shows all reviews the user has created
* User can delete a book saved in their library 
* User can add the dates they have started and finished reading the book
* User home page shows recent activity


### 💪 Features I am working on to include:
* Currently have reached MVP

### 🎯 Current Focus:
* Tidy up CSS code
* Refactor code
* Ensure webpage is compliant with WAVE Web Accessibility 

### ⚙️ Languages, Tools & Technologies:
* React
* Typescript
* Tailwind
* SQLite (with knex.js)
* Node.js
* Superagent
* Express
* GoogleBooks api

### ♿ Accessibility:
I will be making sure this web application is accessible by running the WAVE extension on each of my pages to make sure it is compatible with screen readers and allows for keyboard only navigation. I will ensure all buttons have concise and specific labelling and that my images have descriptive alt text to describe what they are to a user. 

### 📝 Feedback
As I am continuously learning while I am creating this app, I am happy to receive any feedback, tips, tricks and advice you may have on this app. 😊
